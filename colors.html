  <p>Final Cut Pro vs. Premiere Pro</p>

    <h1>Final Cut Pro</h1>
    <p>FCP has a couple of useful preset color combos. However, the way the filters work is essentially putting a screen of
    color in front of your video and lowering the opacity to a pleasing tone.  If you want to adjust the filters, there is little
    you can do.  You can also play a little with saturation and keying, but can only really scratch the surface as far as
    all the possibilities of color correction.</p>
  </div>

    <div class="column" style="background-color:Transparent;">
    <h1>Premiere Pro</h1>
    <p>Premiere Pro and the adobe apps are certainly the way to go with colors and filters.  Not only are the preset filters
    much better than Final Cut, but Premiere Pro gives the user the ability to get incredibly creative with colors and masterfully
    color-correct your footage. White-balancing your clips could not be made easier and keying your footage is a customizable as
    one could imagine.</p>

<p>Premiere Pro is clearly the more sophisticated software with colors and filters.  It is better in every way except one; time commitment.
Final Cut Pro is much quicker to use and works basically off of a drag-and-drop model.  In Premiere Pro, you have to mess
    around with color combinations until you find the theme you are looking for. This doesn't usually take too long, but it is
 something to consider.</p>
