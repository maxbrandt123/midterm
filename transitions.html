  <p>Final Cut Pro vs. Premiere Pro</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column" style="background-color:Transparent;">
    <h1>Final Cut Pro</h1>
    <p>There is not much to explain here-Final Cut Pro come pre-loaded with the basic transitions like gradually fading and
    wipes, but you can't really make your own.  You can purchase additional transitions online, but your creativity is
        certainly limited.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="column" style="background-color:Transparent;">
    <h1>Premiere Pro</h1>
    <p>Transitions may be my personal favorite part of Premiere Pro.  It does come with some pre-loaded oes like Final Cut,
        but with Premiere Pro, you as a creator are truly given a chance to 'WOW' the viewer of your content by making
    your own transitions. My favorite transition style to work with is using the easy-ease tool to wipe footage in naturally.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Choosing between the two softwares here come down to timing.  Final Cut is a super simple drag-and-drop system, but limits
you.  Premiere Pro lets you do whatever you want, but it takes a while.</p>
