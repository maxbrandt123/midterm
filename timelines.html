  <p>Final Cut Pro vs. Premiere Pro</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column" style="background-color:Transparent;">
    <h1>Final Cut Pro</h1>
    <p>The Final Cut Pro timeline is based around a magnetic field-the clips are automatically brought next to each other
    after anything in the middle is deleted.  This is very helpful in learning hot to edit.  You can have as many layers of
    video as you want, but th software is not made to work with lots of overlapping audio files.</p>
  </div>

    <br>

    <div class="column" style="background-color:Transparent;">
    <h1>Premiere Pro</h1>
    <p>Premiere Pro is initially not set with a magnetic timeline, but it can set to act as one. A non-magnetic timeline is
    better for working with a high number of clips/videos.  It allows you to switch the order of your clips with ease.</p>
  </div>

<br>
<p>I would personally recommend using Premiere Pro, but there are certainly advantages to both. I would sayif you are
just trying to edit a few video clips at a time, Final Cut Pro would be better, but dealing with a great number of clips would
better with Premier Pro.</p>
